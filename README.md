# Autonomous-Vehicle-Simulator

AutoDriveSim is a simulated environment for training and testing autonomous vehicles using neural networks. The simulator provides a road environment where the autonomous vehicle learns to navigate and avoid collisions with other vehicles.

## Features

- **Realistic Simulation**: The simulator provides a realistic road environment with other vehicles, traffic signals, and obstacles.
- **Neural Network Training**: Users can train neural networks to control the autonomous vehicle using reinforcement learning or other techniques.
- **Collision Detection**: The simulator includes collision detection to reset the simulation when the vehicle collides with another object.
- **Visualization**: The simulator provides visualization tools to monitor the training progress and visualize the behavior of the autonomous vehicle.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the simulator:
   ```bash
   python main.py

##Usage
1. Use the arrow keys to control the autonomous vehicle manually.
2. Train neural networks using reinforcement learning or other techniques to control the vehicle automatically.
3. Visualize the training progress and behavior of the autonomous vehicle using the provided tools.
